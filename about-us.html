Do you have something difficult to ship, unusual size, overweight, or unusual origin? Maybe you need someone to pay the seller on your behalf so you do not get burnt? Do you need help with regulations and customs? Then talk to us!<br /><br>We do not shy away from the hard jobs. Any freight forwarder can ship a cardboard box from one country to another, but very few have the specialist knowledge and skills to ship the hard shipments.<br /><br>Over the years we have developed strong relationships with our partners overseas who are also passionate about things like machinery, yachts, vehicles, and anything that is a little different. Ourselves and our overseas partners have negotiated large contracts specifically for shipping these kinds of items, so we offer preferential pricing. In some cases our overseas partners even own their own ships!<br />
                      <br />
                We are equipped with  technical know-how personnel and logistics to effectively carry out  assignments on the ground and in the office effectively giving us hands-on service to all our customers at all  times. Our experienced team has expertise in the area of ports and agencies including:<br />
                Port Agency &ndash; Air & Sea Freight Services &ndash; Consultancy &amp; Customs  Documentations & Clearing &amp; Freight Forwarding - Logistics - Cargo Canvassing &ndash; Haulage Services and many others. <br />
                <br />
                We do not only possess the know-how but also make use of modern technology to effect seamless customer service. Safe Hands Express is at your service 24/7 to receive and respond to any queries or contact us through our email or phone.</p></td>
